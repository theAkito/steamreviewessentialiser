## What
Fetches all reviews from a Steam game, then aggregates keywords found in them. Finally, the keywords are displayed in a tag cloud, where the most used keywords are shown biggest and the least used ones are shown smallest.
This way, you can get a first impression about a Steam game, within a minute of reading, instead of reading a couple reviews for 20 minutes, for example.

## Why
I like to read Steam reviews. Sometimes I do it, to quickly grasp what issues might arise from the game. For example, it's not fun to play a theoretically good game, which is in reality riddled with bugs.
So, if most negative reviews mention the word "bug" I can quickly see that word pointed out to me in the displayed tag cloud, when using this app.

## How
Work in Progress

## Where
Linux

## Goals
* Maintain Simplicity!

## Project Status
Alpha. Unstable API.

Server is working so far.
At this moment, retrieval of Tag Clouds via API of the server has to be concluded manually through API requests, by using cURL or similar HTTP clients.

## TODO
* ~~Save state, if review gathering was interrupted by program shutdown.~~
* ~~Use spell correction to correctly group similar or same words.~~
* ~~Maintain openness to variety of clients on different platforms.~~
* ~~Filter words like "is", "it", "that", "this", "these", "those"...~~
* ~~REST API~~
